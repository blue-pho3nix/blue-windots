## Optional Pre-Install

### Create a [restore point](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-protection-e9126e6e-fa64-4f5f-874d-9db90e57645a)
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Optional, but recommended.

### If You Want to Change the Desktop Images
- You can preview the current desktop images [here](https://github.com/blue-pho3nix/blue-windots/tree/main/config/theme/One%20Dark%20Pro/Wallpapers) before installing...
- You can always edit them in your Git clone if you want the diff background images to be automatically set to slideshow during installation.

---

## Required Pre-Install

> [!TIP]
> If You have **fewer/more than 5 monitors**, change the `blue-windots\config\home\Komorebi.json` to meet your needs.

### 1. Install [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) and Mods
> [!NOTE]
> I want to script the entire install for Windhawk, but Windhawk is not currently set up to do so... <br>
> At this point, you can manually install the mods, and the setup for each mod (except UXTheme Hook) will be in the script below.

#### Install the following mods under `Explore`
- Control Panel Color Fix
- Resource Redirect
- Windows 11 File Explorer Styler
- Windows 11 Notification Center Styler
- Windows 11 Start Menu Styler
- Windows 11 Taskbar Styler
- UXTheme hook

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to ensure `winlogon.exe` and `logonui.exe`  are in windhawk's process inclusion list, in its advanced settings of UXTheme hook. The theme doesn't really have settings for the login/lock screen.

### 2. Install Powershell 7

winget install Microsoft.PowerShell

## Pre Install

### If you want to change your Desktop images
- You can preview the current desktop images [here](https://github.com/blue-pho3nix/blue-windots/tree/main/config/theme/One%20Dark%20Pro/Wallpapers) before installing... You can always edit them in your Git clone if you really want the diff background images to be auto-set to slideshow during installation.

### If you have fewer/more than 5 monitors
- Change the `blue-windots\config\home\komorebi.json` to meet your needs.

## More Info

Let's say you want to edit you komorebi config file after install. <br>

### Here's how you can do it

1. Edit `C:\Users\<your_username>\komorebi.json` 
2. Save the file.  
3. Open a regular powershell window (`win + enter`).
4. Stop and start komorebi or reload the configuration.
> Make sure to always use `--ahk` to keep the autohotkeys working.  When you stop/restart komorebi, you'll need to reload autohotkey. 
```
komorebic stop --ahk
```
```
komorebic start --ahk
```
or
```
komorebic reload-configuration
```
